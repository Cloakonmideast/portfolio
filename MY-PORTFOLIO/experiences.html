                <h2> AI and ML internship</h2>
                <p>An AI/ML internship typically offers a hands-on opportunity to delve into the realms of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML). As an intern, you'll likely engage in a variety of tasks such as data preprocessing, model development, training, validation, and evaluation. Depending on the company or organization offering the internship, you may work on real-world projects that involve computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, or other AI/ML subfields.

                    Interns often collaborate with experienced professionals, learning from their expertise while also contributing fresh perspectives and ideas. You might participate in team meetings, present your findings or progress, and receive feedback to refine your skills.</p>
